# 8.0 DB Operations and Classes

Before I discuss database and class operations, let's first touch on some basics.

**Double and Single Quotes**

What is the difference between these 2 lines?
 
```php
echo 'hello world' 
echo "hello world" 
```

The diference is that the second line, using double quotes, all vars inside get interpreted
```php
$vin='hello' 
echo "$vin world" 
```

will output <br> 
**hello world**<br>
While with single quotes 

```php
$vin='hello' 
echo '$vin world' 
```

will output <br>
**$vin world**

### Variables and Concatenation

Concatenation allows us to join several strings or vars together. The concate symbol in PHP is the point (.) .Let's look at some examples to better understand.

```php
//example 1
echo '2'+'2' 
//Will output  4
 
//example 2
echo '2'.'2' 
//Will output  22
```

We can concate using a mixture of vars and strings 


```php
$name='Johny Walker' 
$town='Biaritz' 
 
$str= 'Hello my name is '. $name . ' and I live in the city of ' . $town 
 
echo $str 
// This will output  Hello my name is Johny Walker and I live in the city of Biaritz
```



### CRUD

There are four basic functions of database (DB) operations you will most commonly use  **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete  which are generaly refered to as **CRUD**. In my previous tutorials, I’ve focused on Read and Create, now I will provide examples for all these functions.

**Create**

```php
$query = "Insert into ".$xoopsDB->prefix("tutorial_myform")." (name, address, telephone, email) values ('$name', '$address', '$tel', '$email' )" 
$res=$xoopsDB->query($query) 
if(!$res) {
echo "error  $query" 
}
```

**Read**
```php
$query = $xoopsDB->query(' SELECT * FROM ' . $xoopsDB->prefix('tutorial_myform') " WHERE id='$myid' ") 
$myrow = $xoopsDB->fetchArray($query) 
$name = $myrow['name'] 
$address = $myrow['address'] 
$telephone = $myrow['telephone'] 
$email = $myrow['email'] 
```

**Update**
```php
$query = "UPDATE ".$xoopsDB->prefix("tutorial_myform")." SET deff=1 WHERE sid='$newdef' " 
$res=$xoopsDB->query($query) 
if(!$res) echo "error  $query" 
```

**Delete**
```php
$query = "Delete from ".$xoopsDB->prefix("tutorial_myform")." WHERE sid='$test' " 
$res=$xoopsDB->query($query) 
if(!$res) {
echo "error  $query" 
}
```

**Important**  Create, update and delete require that your data be retrieved using $_POST. If you are using a diferent method GET, SESSION, etc then you will have to use a diferent query, this is a built in function of Xoops  
```php
$query = "Delete from ".$xoopsDB->prefix("tutorial_myform")." WHERE sid='$test' " 
$res=$xoopsDB->queryF($query) 
if(!$res) {
echo "error  $query" 
}
```

It's been discussed before on xoops.org forums, so do a search if you wish to learn more about this.

### Xoops and MySQL Statements

The advantages of using this method are enourmous, you don't have to worry about opening connections to the database or closing them for ex, so I highly recommend that you connect to your modules tables using this Xoops method.
When manipulating the Xoops database, there is 3 steps we need to perform 

**1- Build the SQL statement**

```php
$query = "Delete from ".$xoopsDB->prefix("tutorial_myform")." WHERE sid='$test' " 
```

This statement can be divided into 3 parts. The first part holds our sql command, in our example "Delete from ". The second part .$xoopsDB->prefix("tutorial_myform"). is the xoops table we want to manipulate. Using this method, xoops will automatically concate the xoops prefix to our table. The third part " WHERE sid='$test' "  is where we can perform conditions to our statement.(You can read more about this at www.mysql.org)

**2- Perform the Query**

```php
$res=$xoopsDB->query($query) 
```

Now we take **$query** and execute it using **$res=$xoopsDB->query($query)** .

**3 - Check if change was sucessfull**

```php
if(!$res) {
echo "error  $query" 
}
```

**Create, update and delete,** when executed will return a **TRUE** or **FALSE** argument to **$res**, this allows us to perform a simple if statement to know if any error ocurred when trying to change the database.

### Manipulating One or Several Rows
There will be times that you want to manipulate one or several rows of your table. Lets take a deeper look into this using as an example my client tables from part 5.

**table_client**

|cliente_id|name|email|
|-|-|-|
|12|john anton|john11q@johhny.com|
|13|ric senten|senten2333@yahoo.com|



**table_client_phones**

|phone_id|table_client_id|phone_type|phone_number|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|12|home|2346554|
|2|12|mobile|7851232|
|3|12|office|4576598|
|4|13|home|1253654|
|5|3|mobile|8786521|

Delete is one of the easiest, so let's look at it first.
If I delete client john anton I also want to delete all phone numbers associated with him.
```php
$name='john anton' //Get client name
 
$query = $xoopsDB->query(' SELECT * FROM ' . $xoopsDB->prefix('tutorial_myform') " WHERE name='$name' ") //build our sql statement
$myrow = $xoopsDB->fetchArray($query)  //get the single row of data and place in an array called $myrow
$clientID = $myrow['cliente_id']  //retrieve from array $myrow the element called cliente_id and place it in a var called $clientID
 
//Delete all phone numbers belonging to client $name, in this example 'john anton'
$query = "Delete from ".$xoopsDB->prefix("table_client_phones")." WHERE table_client_id='$clientID' " 
$res=$xoopsDB->query($query) 
if(!$res) {
echo "error  $query" 
}
 
// Delete client 'john anton'
$query = "Delete from ".$xoopsDB->prefix("table_client")." WHERE cliente_id='$clientID' " 
$res=$xoopsDB->query($query) 
if(!$res) {
echo "error  $query" 
}
```


The first step was to get john anton's ID from table_client. We then use that to delete all his phone numbers. Mysql takes care of finding all rows that match my condition, in this case WHERE table_client_id='$clientID'. Finally we delete john anton from table_client. You will also notice I use the same var's throughout my code, such as $query. This is perfectly aceptable in such a case because at the end of each database operation (we have 3 in this example), they no longer are usefull in my example. I also use this method to keep code simple. I know that $query is always an sql statement.

### Classes – a Basic Overview
A class is basicly composed of 2 elements 
1. Functions
1. 
Global Vars (in the class)

Both functions and vars can be private,public or protected, meaning that, if they are private they can only be used by the class itself, while if they are public, they can be called and used outside of the class. Note  This is a php 5 functionality.
reference [php5](http://uk.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php) 

![](../assets/info/important.png)
**Important**  PHP 4 end of life has been schedulued for 31-12-2007. Meaning no further updates will be provided after this date. Xoops will also be built for php 5 funcionality sometime in 2008, so you might want to start learning some of this new OOP (reference  [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [php.net](http://uk.php.net/manual/en/migration5.oop.php)) structure that php 5 provides. Also keep in mind that these new functions don't work on servers running only php 4. If you code a module that uses these features, some users won't be able to use your module. This has been debated a lot on [xoops.org](www.xoops.org) forums, do a search if you would like to read opinions from other developers.

Functions can call on each other and also manipulate global vars.

Let’s look at a practical example 

```php
Class testing
{
var $msg 
 
function setMsg(){
$this->msg =5 
}
 
function getInfo(){
$lod=$this->msg 
return $lod 
}
 
function chkData(){
}
}
```
Here we have a class with 3 functions and one global var. In order to use a class, you must first declare it 

```php
$test= new testing 
```

Now var **$test** has access to all functions and vars of that class, you can use $test on all php pages that are included after this line, as long as you set it as global using 

```php
global $test 
```
at the top of each subsequent php file.
I can manipulate the var $msg from outside the class 
```php
$test->msg='hello' 
```

I can also access it's function 
```php
$nan=$test->getInfo() 
echo $nan 
```

will output 5

### Xoops Classes
Xoops has it's own classes([reference](http://dev.xoops.org/modules/phpwiki/index.php/GlobalVariables)), some you already used such $xoopsDB or $xoopsUser. Open **xoops/class** or **xoops/kernel** to see some of these. As long as you declare them as global, you can use any of these in your own classes and functions.
