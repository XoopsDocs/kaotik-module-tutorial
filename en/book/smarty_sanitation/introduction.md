# Smarty and sanitation, oh my!
This chapter directly continues where the last chapter left off - we're going deeper and we are going to extend our knowledge of modules.

We're going to learn what Smarty is, how to use Smarty templates and we're diving deeper into santitation and how important it is for developers.

To continue, you'll need the completed tutorial module we wrote in part 1 (if you don't have it, you download it from GitHub).

We're going to dive in, so good luck!
