# Credits

The tutorials upon which this book has been built have been originally created by [Kaotik](http://www.kaotik.biz).

These have overgone a complete revision by [Kevin Petit](http://ke.vinpet.it) in mid 2016, to update these modules to XOOPS 2.6 and to update them to the current best practices.
This revision is a complete rewrite of the original tutorials, with them being expanded, new chapters and new modules.
