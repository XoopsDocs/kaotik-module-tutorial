#### Adding AJAX to our module!
In this tutorial, we're going to take a look at how to use AJAX in a XOOPS module. To achieve this, we'll be using jQuery - there are other libraries for this, but the one we're going with is jQuery as it's without a doubt the most popular one around.

Now, what is AJAX? AJAX is a technology that allows you to update pieces of (or even your entire) webpages without having to reload. This van be very useful, and when it's correctly implemented, it can really cut on server loads.

When should you use it? This depends on what you want to achieve. If you have a table with dates, you might use AJAX to provide table sorting. If you have a form you're submitting, you can use AJAX there too. 
The possibilites are nearly endless, but don't think it can solve everything.
When used correctly however, it's a very powerfull tool.
