#### Fixing the interface!
Okay, it's been quite a ride already: from a simple Hello World application, we're now up with a nice People-manager!
It does however, look quite bad. That's something that we can fix however!

Please keep in mind that we're going to optimize our entire module for **XOOPS 2.6+** and **xbootstrap** based themes. Old legacy themes will still render our module, but it will simply look a little less good there.
